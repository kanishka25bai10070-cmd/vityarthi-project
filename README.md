It is simple, lightweight, and beginner-friendly.
The project demonstrates how APIs can be integrated into Python.
It includes clean code with modular functions for weather fetching and recommendation logic.
Users only need to enter a city name to get instant results.
The system works using rule-based AI decision-making.
The output is easy to understand and user-focused.
The project can be extended with GUI support.
Future enhancements may include mobile app integration.
The code is fully customizable for personal use.
This project is ideal for learning API handling, JSON parsing, and automation.
